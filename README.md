# Rancid Tomatillos

## Overview

Rancid Tomatillos is an app that lets the user browse movies and find out more about them. The home page shows all the movies available to view, and if you hover over an individual movie it gives you the average rating and the release date, as well as a button which will take you to even more info. If you click on the 'Click here to see more details' button you will be able to see the average rating, the release date, the genres, the budget, the revenue, and the runtime. From here you can go back to the home page, which also has a search feature so you can find exactly what you are looking for.
